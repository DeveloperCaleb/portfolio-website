          <h2> About Caleb </h2>
          <p> After working with automation as a news director and installing automation systems as a broadcast engineer, I fell in love with automation. While I enjoyed TV automation, I love online streaming services and the content that creators provide. I want to bring automation to those creators so that they can have even more control over their content creation. </p>

          <p> As a student of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a> <!--Clicking on the word Thinkgul will open a new tab to Thinkful's website. The target="_blank" attribute is what causes the link to open in a new tab--> I've begun learning the steps necassary to achieve my goals. </p>

          <p> In my free time I like to fool around with 3D-printing. I use both FDM and Resin printers, sometimes I make useful things but mostly miniature scaled models. Which leads to my other primary hobby which is table top gaming with the miniatures I print. It's an extremely fun and rewarding hobby to do with friends. </p>
